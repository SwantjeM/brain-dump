# brain-dump
A web app to empty out your brain, take a few deep breaths, and then look at your brain chaos again in a more relaxed way.
This app uses non-persistent browser storage, so a page refresh will remove the brain-dump data. 

This project uses mostly plain HTML/javaScript/CSS. The box breathing animation was built in p5.js
